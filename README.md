# rbedrock-loadR
"rbedrock-loadR" by hamblingreen: A script relying on  pacman, devtools, tidyverse, and rbedrock whose function is to load and update said packages and output a confirmation/error accordingly. All credit for developing rbedrock goes to Rufus Atticus, this is just a script I made for myself to make it easier to load and update rbedrock.
